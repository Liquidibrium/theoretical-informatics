This repo consist of problems and my solution in theoretical-informatics

## Regular-expresions

directory  Regular-expresions conteins problems about regular expresions and NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automata)

* builder.py - takes regular expresion and returns equivalent Nondeterministic Finite Automata with pre-defined format
* run.py - simulates Nondeterministic Finite Automata

## Turing Machine

* convert.py - converts two tape turing machine into single one
* simulate.py - simulates single tape turing machine
